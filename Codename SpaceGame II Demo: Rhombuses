Codename SpaceGame II Demo: Rhombuses
--------------------------
Codename SpaceGame II is a new kind of game. One that needs no client, and is supported 
anywhere the internet runs and secure shells are supported (hint that's almost everywhere, 
even your grandma's laptop from the nineties). The SpaceGame II server communicates over 
SSH; simply log in to the server and unicode text begins streaming to the client. This text 
is colored, made of unicode pixels, and is served at the terminal resolution 10 times a 
second. With even this relatively low FPS, convincing real-time 3D graphics can be 
approximated, right in the shell, without any form of downloaded game client.

SpaceGame II is completely calculated on the server side, keeping it virtually free for the 
client to run. While only machines that can handle re-programmable color palettes and 256 
colors are supported, more configurations are planned to be supported. The core renderer of 
SpaceGame II is a ray-marcher, giving the game its signature high-fidelity-pixel-art look. 
Colors are calculated in OKLAB, a colorspace focused on human perception, unlike naïve RGB 
implementations and lighting obeys the inverse square law found in the real world. It's a 
hidden gem of the internet, quietly humming away as an art piece in a dusty corner of the 
digital world.

This demo of Codename SpaceGame II showcases some of the new improvements:
	- increased connection stability when more than one client is connected
	- The first non-spherical entity, spaceships.
	- The first example of rendered rotations
	- speed increase created by per-pixel-ray frustum culling


Controls:
--------------------------
← yaw left
→ yaw right
↑ pitch up
↓ pitch down

A roll counterclockwise
D roll clockwise
W thrust forward
S thrust backward

The keen observer may notice the ship rotation in view is not completely faithful. It's on 
the roadmap :-)
