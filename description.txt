Codename SpaceGame II Demo: Rhombuses
--------------------------
Codename SpaceGame II is a new kind of game. One that needs no client, and is supported
anywhere the internet runs and secure shells are supported (hint that's almost everywhere,
even your grandma's laptop from the nineties). The SpaceGame II server communicates over
SSH; simply log in to the server and unicode text begins streaming to the client. This text
is colored, made of unicode pixels, and is served at the terminal resolution 10 times a
second. With even this relatively low FPS, convincing real-time 3D graphics can be
approximated, right in the shell, without any form of downloaded game client.

SpaceGame II is completely calculated on the server side, keeping it virtually free for the
client to run. While only machines that can handle re-programmable color palettes and 256
colors are supported, more configurations are planned to be supported. The core renderer of
SpaceGame II is a ray-marcher, giving the game its signature high-fidelity-pixel-art look.
Colors are calculated in OKLAB, a colorspace focused on human perception, unlike naïve RGB
implementations. Lighting obeys the inverse square law found in the real world. It's a
hidden gem of the internet world which has grown too far from Multi-User Dungeons,
quietly humming away as an art piece in a dusty corner of the digital world.

This demo of Codename SpaceGame II showcases some new improvements:
	- Ability to resize the client on the go
	- Noise based terrain height maps
	- Server running on x86 rather than ARM
	- Alternative

Controls:
--------------------------
← yaw left
→ yaw right
↑ pitch up
↓ pitch down

A roll counterclockwise
D roll clockwise
W thrust forward
S thrust backward
R radar vision

The keen observer may notice the ship rotation in view is not completely faithful. It's on
the roadmap :-)
